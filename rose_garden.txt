When Abraham went to slash Issac
In a sense he baptized him
Rabbi said don't trust in cash prizes
Same things that float your boat can capsize it
Tell the snakes they can take a hike like gas prices
No such things as half-way crooks or half righteous, yeah
Those who have eyes should act like it
To help the sightless seeking the light switch
To see in the night with, we leading the lifeless
Sometimes I just wanna play some shows, make some dough
Take it home, lay in my bed, and stay in my safety zone
But Cee-Lo said it best
I know too much and I owe too much to let it rest
Heard a voice say hey
You never question when you get the blessings
So don't get vexed when your life is stressed
And I promised I'll be with you no matter what the issue
But there will be some issues to address
Listen to the lady in the dress
